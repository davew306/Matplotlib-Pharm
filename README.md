# Matplotlib-Pharm
In this challenge we generated a summary statistics table consisting of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM
We also generated used pyplot to generate a bar plot of various measurements and a pie plot of the distribution of male and female mice
We then calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatments: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
We also generated a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
